**Not an official X SDK.** This is an independent developer tool — a local harness for testing, replaying, and debugging X Activity API webhooks before touching production.

---

## Who this is for

- Developers building X Activity API webhooks or XChat bots
- Teams migrating from legacy DM / AAA to XAA + E2EE
- Anyone debugging CRC failures, signature mismatches, or encrypted payload issues
- Developers who want to replay and diff payloads as X's event schema evolves

**Not for:** end users expecting a production-ready bot runtime or complete official SDK.

---

## Why this exists

Building on XChat means dealing with:

- `chat.received` events that silently fail CRC validation
- Encrypted DM payloads that return `{}` when you look them up via REST
- `dm_events` going quiet after E2EE is enabled on a conversation
- Event format changes that break your handler at 2am

xchat-playground gives you a **local harness** to reproduce, replay, and diff all of the above **before** touching production.

## Scope and honest limits

Aligned with official X Activity API docs as of 2026-04-17.

| Area | Status | Schema |
|------|--------|--------|
| Webhook CRC + signature validation | ✅ Full support | — |
| `profile.update.bio` delivery | ✅ Official docs.x.com example | `docs` |
| `chat.received` envelope | ⚠️ Observed from [xchat-bot-python](https://github.com/xdevplatform/xchat-bot-python) | `observed` |
| `chat.sent` / `chat.conversation_join` | ⚠️ Event names official; payload shape provisional | `demo` |
| Real E2EE decryption (`crypto real`) | ⚠️ Placeholder — awaits `chat-xdk` stable release | — |
| Activity Stream delivery | ℹ️ Not in scope — this tool focuses on the webhook path | — |

**Can be validated against a real X Activity public event today via `profile.update.bio`** — no special OAuth scopes required.

> **Schema labels:** `docs` = matches official docs.x.com delivery example. `observed` = inferred from xchat-bot-python source, not yet in docs.x.com. `demo` = flat teaching format for local testing only.

> **Delivery note:** X Activity API supports both **webhook** (HTTP POST) and **Activity Stream** (long-lived connection). xchat-playground focuses on the webhook path. The official bot template uses Activity Stream. Both are valid — choose based on your architecture.

## What's inside

| Module | CLI | What it does |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| **Event Simulator** | `playground simulate` | Generate `chat.received` / `chat.sent` / `chat.conversation_join` / `profile.update.bio` fixtures |
| **Webhook Harness** | `playground webhook` | CRC challenge + HMAC-SHA256 signature validation playground |
| **Replay Lab** | `playground replay` | Record → scrub PII → replay → diff against your handler |
| **Crypto Sandbox** | `playground crypto` | Stub or real-key decryption flow walkthrough |
| **Repro Packs** | `playground repro` | One-click presets for known community bug reports |
| **Web UI** | `playground serve` | Browser-based event inspector + debug tools |
| **Doctor** | `playground doctor` | Check your environment is ready |

---

## Quickstart (no API key needed)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sherlock-488/xchat-playground
cd xchat-playground
pip install uv && uv sync
uv run playground serve
# → open http://localhost:7474/ui
```

That's it. The Web UI opens with demo events pre-loaded so you're never staring at a blank screen.
No X developer account required for local testing.

---

## CLI Reference

```bash
# Start local server + Web UI
uv run playground serve --port 7474

# Check your environment
uv run playground doctor

# Generate event fixtures
uv run playground simulate chat-received --sender-id 123 --recipient-id 456
uv run playground simulate chat-received --no-encrypted  # plaintext mode
uv run playground simulate batch --count 20 --output fixtures/batch.jsonl

# Webhook tools
uv run playground webhook crc <crc_token> --consumer-secret <secret>
uv run playground webhook verify '<payload>' '<x-twitter-webhooks-signature value>'

# Replay
uv run playground replay run fixtures/batch.jsonl --target http://127.0.0.1:8080/webhook
uv run playground replay diff fixtures/batch.jsonl \
  --baseline-url http://127.0.0.1:8080/webhook \
  --candidate-url http://127.0.0.1:8081/webhook

# Crypto sandbox
uv run playground crypto stub "STUB_ENC_SGVsbG8h"
uv run playground crypto real "REAL_PAYLOAD" --state-file state.json

# Repro packs
uv run playground repro list
uv run playground repro run encrypted-lookup-empty --verbose
uv run playground repro run chat-webhook-not-received --verbose
uv run playground repro run legacy-dm-stops-after-e2ee --verbose
```

## Repro Packs

One-click reproductions of the most common XChat API issues reported in the developer community:

| Pack ID | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| `chat-webhook-not-received` | CRC not handled / localhost URL / secret mismatch / subscription missing |
| `encrypted-lookup-empty` | `GET /2/dm_events/{id}` returns `{}` for E2EE conversations |
| `legacy-dm-stops-after-e2ee` | Legacy DM endpoint stops updating after conversation upgrade |

Run any pack with `--verbose` for step-by-step explanation and workaround.

---

## Live Webhook Testing

To test with a real X webhook registration, expose your local server publicly:

```bash
# Option 1: cloudflared (recommended, free)
npx cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:7474

# Option 2: ngrok
ngrok http 7474
```

Then register the tunnel URL as your webhook in the X Developer Portal.

> **Note:** `http://localhost` and `http://127.0.0.1` are **not** the same in X's OAuth2 validation.
> For local OAuth2 callbacks, use `http://127.0.0.1` — see [Known Gotchas](docs/known-gotchas.md).

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or pip
- X Developer Account (optional — only needed for live webhook testing)

---

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

```bash
# Required for live webhook signature validation
CONSUMER_SECRET=your_app_consumer_secret

# Required for real-key crypto (xchat-bot-python login flow)
# state.json is auto-generated by xchat-bot-python — never commit it
```

## Status: alpha

This is a **pre-1.0 alpha** released around XChat's April 2026 launch.

- CRC, signature, webhook harness, replay, repro packs: stable and tested
- `profile.update.bio`: `docs` schema — matches official docs.x.com delivery example
- `chat.received`: `observed` schema — inferred from xchat-bot-python, not yet in docs.x.com
- `chat.sent` / `chat.conversation_join`: `demo` schema only — payload shape provisional
- `crypto real`: placeholder — will be updated when `chat-xdk` reaches stable release
- X's event schema is actively evolving; this tool is designed to help you catch schema drift

If you find a field mismatch between this tool and what X actually sends, [open an issue](../../issues/new?template=bug_report.md) — that's exactly the kind of feedback that makes this useful.

if it's reproducible, we'll add it as a preset.

> **Policy note for bot builders:** If you use this playground to build automated bots, note that X's Developer Guidelines require automated accounts to carry an Automated label, disclose the operator in bio, and provide opt-out. AI-generated replies require additional approval. This tool is a testing harness — what you build with it is your responsibility.
